## Task Objective

The goal of this task is to explore existing open source AI models—such as large language models (LLMs), natural language processing (NLP) tools, and educational analytics frameworks—and evaluate their potential to be adapted for generating meaningful prompts or insights that assess a student’s depth of understanding and competence.

1. To make this evaluation concrete, use Python programming learning as a test case. Specifically, consider how an AI model might:
2. Analyze student-written Python code to understand the logic and correctness.
3. Generate prompts that effectively assess students’ conceptual understanding and reasoning
4. Identify gaps in reasoning or common misconceptions within the code or explanations
5. Encourage deeper learning through reflection and exploration without directly providing solutions

The evaluation should include an assessment of at least one freely available open source model and a discussion of its potential suitability and limitations for this educational use case.

## Reasoning

**What makes a model suitable for high-level competence analysis?** <br/>
A model suitable for high-level competence analysis must demonstrate deep understanding of both the domain (e.g., Python programming) and the natural language required to engage with students meaningfully. <br/>
It should be capable of analyzing complex inputs like student-written code, identifying conceptual strengths and weaknesses, and generating tailored prompts that encourage reflection and deeper learning without simply providing answers. <br/>
The model's ability to interpret subtle reasoning gaps and misconceptions, while being customizable to specific educational objectives, is also critical for meaningful assessment.

**How would you test whether a model generates meaningful prompts?**
Testing involves creating a benchmark dataset of student code samples annotated with expected competencies, misconceptions, and types of prompts that probe understanding. <br/> 
The model's generated prompts would be evaluated quantitatively for relevance, variety, and correctness in identifying gaps, as well as qualitatively through educator review for pedagogical effectiveness, clarity, and encouragement of metacognitive thinking. <br/> 
Experiments may also measure the impact of prompts on subsequent student performance to validate deeper learning.

**What trade-offs might exist between accuracy, interpretability, and cost?**
There is often a balance between high accuracy and interpretability: highly accurate models (like large LLMs) can act as black boxes with difficult-to-explain reasoning, which may be less transparent for educators. <br/> 
Simpler interpretable models might be easier to trust and debug but lack the nuance for deep competence assessment. <br/>
Cost also factors in: large models may require substantial computational resources, increasing deployment expense and limiting scalability, whereas leaner models are less costly but may sacrifice depth and prompt quality.

**Why did you choose the model you evaluated, and what are its strengths or limitations?**
The chosen model, such as AI4ED, was selected for its direct focus on educational AI, customizable prompt-learning capabilities, and its integration with powerful pre-trained language models that handle both natural language and code understanding. <br/>
Strengths include flexibility in generating tailored prompts aligned with instructional goals and ethical considerations for education. <br/>
Limitations include the need for significant fine-tuning and curated data to handle specific domains like Python programming and potential computational overhead. <br/>
OpenPrompt’s strength lies in prompt engineering flexibility, but applicability to educational code analysis needs careful adaptation.
